# OnePlus Snapdragon Kernel Builder

GitHub Actions pipeline for building selected OnePlus Snapdragon 7 Gen 3(SM7550),
8 Gen 1(SM8450), 8 Gen 2(SM8550), and 8 Gen 3(SM8650) kernels. The repository contains the build
pipeline, validation, packaging, and release automation; kernel sources are
resolved from upstream repositories at build time.

## Supported build profiles

The workflow exposes only device/source combinations that are intentionally
configured. This avoids late failures caused by selecting an incompatible SoC
and source independently.

The OnePlus 10T community source is intentionally labeled `ovaltine`; it is
not presented as a OnePlus 10 Pro source.

The Nord CE4 source projects store their SM7550/crow device support in
`sm8550`-named kernel and modules repositories and build it with the Kalama
GKI fragments plus the benz-specific `CONFIG_OPLUS_DEVICE_DTBS=y` and
`CONFIG_BENZ_DTB=y` make flags. The profiles keep the real `sm7550` device
identity in release metadata while resolving that upstream naming explicitly.
Use the dedicated crDroid profile on crDroid: it pins crDroid's own `16.0`
kernel and modules instead of the unrelated development/Lineage branch, which
is not ABI-compatible with crDroid's first-stage vendor modules.

The OnePlus 12 LineageOS and crDroid profiles also reproduce both device-tree
make assignments, `CONFIG_OPLUS_DEVICE_DTBS=y` from the shared SM8650
BoardConfig and `CONFIG_WAFFLE_DTB=y` from the waffle BoardConfig, on every
make invocation and record them in build provenance. Command-line Kbuild
assignments are not expected to be written back to `.config`; keeping them on
the make command line matches how the ROM builds its kernel and external
modules.

The LunarisOS OnePlus 11 profile follows the kernel source published in the
LunarisOS OTA metadata. Its maintainer kernel uses `lineage-23.2`, while its
matching external modules use the `los` branch; the resolver pins both branches
independently and records both exact commits in the build provenance.

Every package accepts both its custom-ROM codename and the device-specific
stock board IDs published by the corresponding device tree. Generic SoC board
names such as `taro`, `kalama`, and `pineapple` are deliberately excluded so a
package cannot pass the check merely because another phone shares its chipset.
The check remains enabled, and a rejected flash prints all four device values
reported to AnyKernel so a genuinely missing regional alias can be diagnosed
safely.

## Build modes

`Build OnePlus Kernel` offers three modes:

- `Patch/config validation only` clones exact upstream revisions, applies the
  selected KernelSU/KPM/SUSFS/NoMount/ZeroMount integration, verifies the final
  config, and smoke-compiles the affected KPM, SUSFS, VFS, proc, reboot,
  NoMount, and ZeroMount objects without spending time on a full kernel compile.
- `Full build (artifact only)` builds and uploads a 14-day workflow artifact.
  This is the default and does not create a permanent GitHub Release.
- `Full build and publish release` first reserves an immutable tag at the
  workflow commit, builds the same verified artifact, then a separate
  least-privilege job publishes the release from that tag.

Full builds preserve the upstream/vendor ABI-sensitive configuration instead of
forcing debugging, symbol-export, or spinlock options. The pipeline also pins
the kernel release suffix to the exact source commit (for example,
`-g0d516eb3375f`) and verifies that release in the final `Image` banner. This
keeps the kernel vermagic aligned with the ROM's vendor modules while the
selected root preset changes only its required feature options.

## Root integrations

Available workflow presets:

| Preset | Integration | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `No root changes` | No root integration | Baseline |
| `Official KernelSU` | Official KernelSU | Supported |
| `KernelSU-Next` | KernelSU-Next | Supported |
| `KernelSU-Next + SUSFS` | KernelSU-Next with SUSFS | Supported |
| `KernelSU-Next + SUSFS + NoMount (experimental)` | KernelSU-Next with SUSFS and NoMount | Experimental |
| `KernelSU-Next + SUSFS + ZeroMount (experimental)` | KernelSU-Next with SUSFS and ZeroMount | Experimental |
| `KowSU` | KowSU | Supported |
| `SukiSU Ultra + KPM (experimental)` | SukiSU Ultra with KPM | Experimental |
| `SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + KPM (experimental)` | SukiSU Ultra with SUSFS and KPM | Experimental |
| `SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + ZeroMount + KPM (experimental)` | SukiSU Ultra with SUSFS, ZeroMount, and KPM | Experimental |
| `SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + NoMount + KPM (experimental)` | SukiSU Ultra with SUSFS, NoMount, and KPM | Experimental |
| `ReSukiSU` | ReSukiSU | Supported |
| `ReSukiSU + susfs` | ReSukiSU with SUSFS | Supported |
| `ReSukiSU + SUSFS + ZeroMount (experimental)` | ReSukiSU with SUSFS and ZeroMount | Experimental |
| `ReSukiSU + SUSFS + NoMount (experimental)` | ReSukiSU with SUSFS and NoMount | Experimental |

Selecting `Build all 3 featured SUSFS variants (batch)` starts a three-entry
matrix in which all three SUSFS integrations also include NoMount. Selecting
`Build all 3 ZeroMount variants (batch)` instead builds `SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS +
ZeroMount + KPM`, `ReSukiSU + SUSFS + ZeroMount`, and
`KernelSU-Next + SUSFS + ZeroMount`.
Each entry keeps its own package and diagnostics artifact; release mode publishes
all three builds under the same immutable release tag.

KPM is available only through the dedicated SukiSU Ultra presets because current
ReSukiSU no longer supports it. The pipeline resolves SukiSU Ultra to an exact
`main` commit, checks its KPM sources and Kbuild wiring, and enables `CONFIG_KPM`,
`CONFIG_KALLSYMS`, and `CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL`. The SUSFS presets additionally
resolve and apply the matching SUSFS branch at an exact commit. The four-feature
preset also resolves NoMount at an exact commit and enables `CONFIG_KEYS` and
`CONFIG_NOMOUNT`. Validation mode compiles the KPM, SUSFS, VFS, and NoMount
integration objects and checks their exported signatures; a full build repeats
the signature checks against the final kernel artifacts. Both paths fail closed
when expected wiring, config, objects, or symbols are missing. KPM resolver
verification uses AOSP Clang's LTO-aware `llvm-nm` on the compiled resolver
object instead of GNU `nm` on the aggregate LTO intermediate.

The three ZeroMount presets fetch the version-matched VFS patch from a pinned
Super-Builders commit, verify a per-GKI SHA-256, and apply it only after SUSFS.
The pipeline verifies the `getname()` and directory-entry hooks, requires
`CONFIG_ZEROMOUNT=y`, and checks the compiled driver. ZeroMount and NoMount are
kept in separate presets because both implement VFS path redirection and are not
safe to stack without device-specific runtime testing.

SUSFS branches are selected from the SoC and Android/kernel branch. Known vendor
include drift and the current SukiSU Ultra UTS-spoof, KPM resolver, kernel-umount,
and allowlist drift are repaired only for explicitly recognized conflicts. The
compatibility checks keep the KPM symbol resolver linked and initialized and
preserve SukiSU's WebView zygote policy after the SUSFS patch. Unknown patch
rejects fail closed and are included in diagnostics.

The KernelSU-Next + SUSFS presets, including the NoMount and ZeroMount variants,
resolve `pershoot/KernelSU-Next@dev-susfs` to an exact commit. The regular
KernelSU-Next preset remains on the official
`KernelSU-Next/KernelSU-Next@dev` branch. The compatibility branch is required
because the SUSFS KernelSU-side patch does not apply to the current official
development tree; the pipeline still takes the kernel-side SUSFS files and
patch from `simonpunk/susfs4ksu` at an exact commit.

SUSFS builds require upstream v2.2.0 or newer and explicitly verify the
`SUS_MAP` and `OPEN_REDIRECT` features in the final config. The NoMount presets
integrate the exact resolved `master` commit, enable `CONFIG_NOMOUNT=y`, and
checks both source wiring and final kernel signatures. NoMount hooks VFS
operations and is marked experimental by its upstream project, so it remains
an explicit opt-in instead of changing existing build presets.

## Optional kernel features

Two independent boolean workflow inputs toggle extra kernel features:

- `Enable LXC support and apply the required kernel patch` downloads the GKI
  LXC compatibility patch, refuses to continue when it does not apply cleanly,
  and enables the LXC config options (namespaces, IPC, netfilter matches, IP
  sets, tmpfs ACL/xattr, and `CONFIG_USER_NS`). The final config is checked for
  `CONFIG_USER_NS=y`.
- `Enable NTSync support and apply the required kernel patches` applies the
  NTSync base patch plus the Android 13 / 5.15 compatibility patch and enables
  `CONFIG_NTSYNC=y`, which is verified in the generated config.

Both inputs default to off, are part of the build concurrency group, and can be
combined with any root preset.

## Quick start

1. Open `Actions` -> `Build OnePlus Kernel` -> `Run workflow`.
2. Select one device/source profile.
3. Keep automatic branch and Clang selection unless testing a known branch.
4. Select the root integration.
5. Start with `Patch/config validation only` after an upstream update, then run
   a full build when validation passes.
6. Use release mode only for an artifact you intend to keep or distribute.

Manually selected branch names are validated with Git before they are written
to GitHub Actions environment files. Every kernel, modules, root implementation,
SUSFS, NoMount, ZeroMount patches, and AnyKernel input are resolved to exact
commits before cloning.

## Build performance

The full build passes `CC="ccache clang"` and host compiler wrappers directly
on every `make` invocation so Kbuild cannot replace the ccache launcher.
Build timestamps, user, and host metadata are deterministic for a given kernel
commit, which improves repeat-build cache hits.

The workflow also:

- clones kernel and modules repositories in parallel at exact commits
- caches the exact pinned AOSP Clang archive
- restores a profile/branch/compiler-specific 3 GB compressed ccache
- reports config, compile, total time, and ccache statistics in the job summary
- uses an adaptive 8/16 GB swap file with low swappiness for full builds

GitHub cache entries are an optimization only. A build remains able to download
or regenerate every cached input.

## Safe packaging and provenance

Generated AnyKernel3 ZIPs enable `do.devicecheck=1` and contain only the
device-specific codenames and stock board IDs assigned to the selected profile.
Android version checking is also enabled when the selected branch identifies a
known Android generation. The installer targets the current active `boot`
partition by name, refuses to continue unless the resolved `boot_a`/`boot_b`
path matches that slot, splits and rebuilds the boot image without unpacking
its ramdisk, and replaces only the kernel Image. This supports newer devices such as OnePlus 11,
where the first-stage ramdisk lives in `init_boot` and `boot` legitimately has
no ramdisk, while preserving a boot ramdisk when one is present. Upstream
AnyKernel example-device paths and demo ramdisk edits are not included. KPM
packages replace AnyKernel's legacy 32-bit ARM BusyBox and
MagiskBoot with verified AArch64 builds. BusyBox comes from the exact SukiSU
source revision used by the build; MagiskBoot comes from a pinned official
Magisk APK with both archive and extracted-binary SHA-256 verification. On
arm64-only SoCs such as the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in OnePlus 12, the installer
also discards the manager app's incompatible ARM32 `mkbootfs` injection and
uses BusyBox `cpio` instead. Other unused ARM32 AnyKernel partition utilities
are removed, and packaging fails if any remaining native runtime tool is not
ELF64/AArch64.

Each full build produces `release-assets/` containing:

- a device-checked AnyKernel3 ZIP
- a uniquely named raw `Image`
- `build-info.json` with all exact source commits, the KPM enabled state, and
  the workflow run URL
- `SHA256SUMS`
- generated `release-notes.md`

GitHub Actions uploads these release-ready files as one flat package artifact.
Build logs and configuration are kept in a separate diagnostics artifact,
along with `kpm-source-proof.txt` and `kpm-proof.txt` when KPM is selected (and
equivalent SUSFS/NoMount proofs for those presets). The release job downloads
only the package artifact and verifies its checksums before publishing.

The same `build-info.json` is embedded in the flashable ZIP. Keep a known-good
stock boot image available and never flash a package whose device check does
not match the phone.

## CI security and reliability

The tag-reservation job has `contents: write` but checks out and executes no
repository or external source. The build job keeps read-only repository
permissions and does not persist checkout credentials, so external kernel
Makefiles never run with release write credentials. After a successful build,
the separate publication job receives `contents: write`, verifies the reserved
tag and artifact checksums, and creates the Release. A failed build removes its
unused reserved tag automatically.

Network Git operations use bounded retries. Release creation and asset uploads
are idempotent, time-limited, and retried, preventing a stalled upload from
holding the build runner indefinitely.

All third-party GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit hashes. AOSP Clang
archive URLs are pinned to exact Gitiles commits, and changing the downloader
invalidates the toolchain cache.

## Validation and upstream health

Pushes and pull requests run:

- Bash syntax checks
- ShellCheck at warning severity
- offline tests for all twelve profile mappings, root mappings (including the
  three ZeroMount variants), Clang selection, KPM configuration, SUSFS
  selection/version floor, NoMount/ZeroMount selection and wiring,
  Android version inference, and workflow option synchronization
- actionlint for all workflow files

`Check upstream health` runs every Monday and can also be started manually. It
resolves exact commits for all twelve profiles, then runs a twenty-five-job
smoke-test matrix: KernelSU-Next + SUSFS + NoMount, SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS +
NoMount + KPM
(including the crDroid OnePlus 12 / Android 6.1 vendor include drift),
and ReSukiSU + SUSFS + NoMount are validated on representative SM7550 (including
both CE4 source families), SM8450, SM8550, and SM8650 sources, with an additional
baseline validation for the LunarisOS OnePlus 11 and crDroid OnePlus 12 sources.
The SukiSU Ultra ZeroMount preset is validated across the representative
5.10, 5.15, and 6.1 source families; the KernelSU-Next and ReSukiSU ZeroMount
presets additionally run against the representative SM8550 LineageOS source.

## Important limitations

- A successful build does not prove that a kernel is safe for every firmware,
  region, or boot stack of the listed device.
- Community sources are not official OnePlus sources.
- Manual or unusual branches may disable Android version checking when their
  version cannot be inferred safely.
- This pipeline builds the raw GKI `Image`; it does not rebuild every vendor
  module or replace device-specific firmware.
- NoMount and ZeroMount modify VFS behavior and their upstreams label them
  experimental. Test their opt-in presets on a recoverable device before
  distributing them.
- KPM dynamically patches kernel behavior at runtime. Treat all SukiSU Ultra
  presets as experimental and test them only on a recoverable device.
- Runtime performance tuning is intentionally left at upstream/vendor config
  defaults. Options such as KASAN, LTO mode, scheduler changes, and compiler
  optimization flags require device-specific boot, stability, power, and
  benchmark testing before becoming defaults.
